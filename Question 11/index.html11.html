            ELSP_0100: Grammar and Composition I
            ELSP courses are graded as satisfactory or unsatisfactory. The course grades appear on students’ university transcripts as three-credit-hour courses. The credit hours do not count toward fulfilling graduation requirements for any degree programs. However, ELSP courses combined with an appropriate number of other MU courses satisfy full-time enrollment requirements for immigration purposes for students on an F-1 visa. For example, an undergraduate student who enrolls in one ELSP course must take at least nine credit hours of other university coursework; an undergraduate student who takes two ELSP courses must enroll in at least six additional credit hours.</p>
